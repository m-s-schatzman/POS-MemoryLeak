Program for CSE216

COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS
USELESS ADDITION FOR TESTING
To Compile: From the Application/ folder run the command ./make_script.sh to run the automated compile process. This will create the OutputTree directory to store the compiled classes and put all compiled classes into that directory.
Note: to run the make_script.sh bash script, you may need to use the command "chmod 700 make_script.sh" while in the Application folder. This should fix problem.

To Run: from the Application/ folder run the command ./run_script.sh to run the automated run process. This will set the correct directory to run the compiled Main.java class out of.

To Add Files to Compile: in the Application/makefile file, please include the file and the directory it is in, in the list of java files to be compiled. Please ensure the program compiles before pushing changes to the remote repository.


USING GIT

Getting access to remote repository: Please create folder on your own machine to store local copy of the repository. Once inside of this repository use the command "git clone https://GITHUBUSERNAME@github.com/m-s-schatzman/POS-MemoryLeak.git NEWGITREPOSITORYNAME". This will pull the repository onto your own machine. Once this is done, you should be able to do the standard pull, make changes, add, commit, repeat, pull, push workflow. See the slides for more info about how to do this.
